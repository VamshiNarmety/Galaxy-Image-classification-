# Galaxy Image Classification
## Introduction  
This project focuses on classifying galaxies based on their shapes and structures using deep learning. The dataset comes from the Galaxy Zoo Challenge on Kaggle, which is part of the Galaxy Zoo initiative. In this initiative, thousands of volunteers classified galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), creating a rich and well-labeled dataset for research.
